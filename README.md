# loop-through-sf-records

This is just a small demo of how to do a lookup to a data extension and display records based on the results. This will only work on a CloudPage.

There are two samples - one for checkboxes, the other for a select menu. The same logic can be applied to form fields.

Both samples have a loop within a loop. The outer look creates a family of records, the inner look is the items within a family. If you do not need to create sections, isolate the inner loop.
